![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

A simple, interactive, command-line tool to securely generate wallets for the Octra network. [cite_start]All keys are generated offline, and full wallet details are automatically saved to a local `.txt` file for your records[cite: 2].

### ‚ú® Features (Wallet Generator)
* **Interactive Prompt:** No need for command-line arguments. [cite_start]The script asks you how many wallets you want to create[cite: 3, 4].
* [cite_start]**Multiple Wallet Generation:** Create one or hundreds of wallets in a single run[cite: 5].
* **Secure & Offline:** All cryptographic operations happen locally on your machine. [cite_start]The script makes no internet connections, ensuring your keys are never exposed[cite: 6, 7].
* [cite_start]**Automatic File Saving:** Each generated wallet's full details are saved to a unique, timestamped `.txt` file for maximum security and easy management[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Clean Console Output:** The terminal displays only the most essential information (Address, Public/Private Keys), while the comprehensive data is stored securely in the generated files[cite: 9].

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Wallet Generator)

#### Prerequisites
[cite_start]You must have **Node.js** (version 18.x or higher) installed on your system[cite: 10].

    * **Multi-Send from File:** Automate sending transactions to a list of recipients specified in `recipentaddress.txt`. Supports **randomized recipient order**, **multiple runs**, and **configurable retry attempts for failed transactions**.
    * **Encrypted Balance Management:** Securely move funds between your public and encrypted (private) balances, with **configurable retry attempts for failed operations**.
    * **Private Transfers:** Send tokens directly from your encrypted balance to another Octra address. Supports **randomized recipient order**, **multiple runs**, and **configurable retry attempts for failed transfers**.
    * **Claim Private Transfers:** Easily claim pending private transfers addressed to your wallet(s), with **configurable retry attempts for failed claims**.
* **Automated "Daily Multi Send" Mode:** Configure the tool to automatically perform multi-send operations at a predefined daily interval. **This mode can be set up for a single selected wallet or across all loaded wallets.** **Includes configurable retry attempts for failed transactions within daily runs.** To stop the daily mode, **press `Ctrl+C`**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation (CLI Management Tool)

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation (CLI Management Tool)

#### Prerequisites
You must have **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system.

#### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anggafajarsidik/OFFoctra
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd OFFoctra/CLI
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Prepare your wallet data:**
    * Create a `wallet.json` file in the main directory. This file should contain your wallet private keys, addresses, and RPC URLs.
        * **Example for a single wallet:**
            ```json
            {
              "priv": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_B64",
              "addr": "YOUR_OCTRA_ADDRESS",
              "rpc": "https://octra.network",
              "name": "MyMainWallet"
            }
            ```
        * **Example for multiple wallets:**
            ```json
            [
              {
                "priv": "PRIVATE_KEY_1_B64",
                "addr": "OCTRA_ADDRESS_1",
                "rpc": "https://octra.network",
                "name": "Wallet1"
              },
              {
                "priv": "PRIVATE_KEY_2_B64",
                "addr": "OCTRA_ADDRESS_2",
                "rpc": "https://octra.network",
                "name": "Wallet2"
              }
            ]
            ```
    * (Optional) Create a `proxy.txt` file (one proxy URL per line) if you wish to use proxies for your transactions.
    * (Optional) Create a `recipentaddress.txt` file (one Octra address per line) if you plan to use the multi-send feature.

### üíª How to Use (CLI Management Tool)

1.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    python3 cli.py
    ```
2.  **The script will load your wallets and present an interactive menu.**
3.  **Follow the on-screen prompts** to select a wallet (or all wallets) and execute commands like sending transactions, encrypting/decrypting balances, or managing private transfers.

### üìù Key Operations & Commands (CLI Management Tool)

Once the script is running, you will be presented with a main menu. Here are some of the actions you can perform:

* `[1] Send Transaction`: Initiate a standard public transaction.
* `[2] Refresh Wallet(s)`: Update balance, nonce, and transaction history. This is the only command that will display the Wallet Explorer summary.
* `[3] Multi Send from File`: Send funds to multiple recipients listed in `recipentaddress.txt`.
* `[4] Encrypt Balance`: Move funds from your public balance to your encrypted balance.
* `[5] Decrypt Balance`: Move funds from your encrypted balance to your public balance.

## üìä Format to Json (FormatToJson.js)
* in JSON format. You'll be prompted to enter details like Octra addresses and private keys (B64) for each wallet. The final output is a JSON array ready for use on Octra Testnet
 * How to Use:
 * 1. Ensure Node.js is installed.
 * 2. Run from your terminal: `node formattojson.js`
 * 3. Follow the on-screen prompts.
 * FormatToJson.js in the GenerateWallet directory will display the JSON output in your console once all data has been entered. You can then copy it and use it in any script that requires it.
 * FormatToJson.js in the CLI directory will generate and save the data to a wallet.json file, which can be used directly. If a wallet.json file already exists, it will be overwritten when you run the script again. So, make sure to always back up your wallet.json file if it contains important data before running FormatToJson.js again.
