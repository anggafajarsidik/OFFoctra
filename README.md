![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

A simple, interactive, command-line tool to securely generate wallets for the Octra network. [cite_start]All keys are generated offline, and full wallet details are automatically saved to a local `.txt` file for your records[cite: 2].

### ‚ú® Features (Wallet Generator)
* **Interactive Prompt:** No need for command-line arguments. [cite_start]The script asks you how many wallets you want to create[cite: 3, 4].
* [cite_start]**Multiple Wallet Generation:** Create one or hundreds of wallets in a single run[cite: 5].
* **Secure & Offline:** All cryptographic operations happen locally on your machine. [cite_start]The script makes no internet connections, ensuring your keys are never exposed[cite: 6, 7].
* [cite_start]**Automatic File Saving:** Each generated wallet's full details are saved to a unique, timestamped `.txt` file for maximum security and easy management[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Clean Console Output:** The terminal displays only the most essential information (Address, Public/Private Keys), while the comprehensive data is stored securely in the generated files[cite: 9].

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Wallet Generator)

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation (CLI Management Tool)

#### Prerequisites
You must have **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system.

#### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anggafajarsidik/OFFoctra]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd OFFoctra/CLI
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Prepare your wallet data:**
    * Create a `wallet.json` file in the main directory. This file should contain your wallet private keys, addresses, and RPC URLs.
        * **Example for a single wallet:**
            ```json
            {
              "priv": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_B64",
              "addr": "YOUR_OCTRA_ADDRESS",
              "rpc": "https://octra.network",
              "name": "MyMainWallet"
            }
            ```
        * **Example for multiple wallets:**
            ```json
            [
              {
                "priv": "PRIVATE_KEY_1_B64",
                "addr": "OCTRA_ADDRESS_1",
                "rpc": "https://octra.network",
                "name": "Wallet1"
              },
              {
                "priv": "PRIVATE_KEY_2_B64",
                "addr": "OCTRA_ADDRESS_2",
                "rpc": "https://octra.network",
                "name": "Wallet2"
              }
            ]
            ```
    * (Optional) Create a `proxy.txt` file (one proxy URL per line) if you wish to use proxies for your transactions.
    * (Optional) Create a `recipentaddress.txt` file (one Octra address per line) if you plan to use the multi-send feature.

### üíª How to Use (CLI Management Tool)

1.  **Run the script from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    python3 cli.py
