## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Prompt:** No need for command-line arguments. The script asks you how many wallets you want to create.
* **Multiple Wallet Generation:** Create one or hundreds of wallets in a single run.
* **Secure & Offline:** All cryptographic operations happen locally on your machine. The script makes no internet connections, ensuring your keys are never exposed.
* **Automatic File Saving:** Each generated wallet's full details are saved to a unique, timestamped `.txt` file for maximum security and easy management.
* **Clean Console Output:** The terminal displays only the most essential information (Address, Public/Private Keys), while the comprehensive data is stored securely in the generated files.
